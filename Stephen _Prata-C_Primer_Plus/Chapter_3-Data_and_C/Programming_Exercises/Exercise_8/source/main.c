 Description : In the U.S. system of volume measurements, a pint is 2 cups,
               a cup is 8 ounces, an ounce is 2 tablespoons, and a tablespoon
               is 3 teaspoons. Write a program that requests a volume in cups
               and that displays the equivalent volumes in pints, ounces,
               tablespoons, and teaspoons. Why does a floating-point type make
               more sense for this application than an integer type?

    // float is better because it stores fractional parts of quotients
    // and volumes can be real numbers as well
