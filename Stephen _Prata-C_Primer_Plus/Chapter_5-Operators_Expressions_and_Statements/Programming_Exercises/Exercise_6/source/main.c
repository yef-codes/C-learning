 Description : Now modify the program of Programming Exercise 5 so that it
               computes the sum of the squares of the integers. (If you prefer,
               how much money you receive if you get $1 the first day, $4 the
               second day, $9 the third day, and so on. This looks like a much
               better deal!) C doesn’t have a squaring function, but you can
               use the fact that the square of n is n * n.
