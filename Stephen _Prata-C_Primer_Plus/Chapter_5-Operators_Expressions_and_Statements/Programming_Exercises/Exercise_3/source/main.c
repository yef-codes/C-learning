 Description : Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of days
               and then converts that value to weeks and days. For example, it
               would convert 18 days to 2 weeks, 4 days. Display results in the
               following format:
                18 days are 2 weeks, 4 days.
               Use a while loop to allow the user to repeatedly enter day
               values; terminate the loop when the user enters a nonpositive
               value, such as 0 or -20.
